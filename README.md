# Assignment 2: Naive Bayes for text classification

## Description
In this project, we focus on developing and training a Large Language Model (LLM)
based on the transformer architecture, targeting the IsNdebele language (NR),
which is classified as a low-resourced language in South Africa. We leveraged the
NCHLT text corpora made available by the South African Centre for Digital Lan-
guage Resources (SADiLaR) for our dataset.

## Getting Startedy
